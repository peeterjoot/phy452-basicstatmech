- probably remove: midterm1review.tex (now in the appendix)

- why eqnref instead of cref?

- dups?
         \input{centralLimitOnProducts.tex}
         \input{productOfIIDCLT.tex}

- thermo chapter needs some reorg.

- toss in typo note for text into the appendix once confirmed.

- phase space chapter needs some reorg.

- probably eliminate the 'outline oof midterm I' solutions item.

- fixme's in lecture 17 (and perhaps elsewhere)

- check signs for all the n^b n_f results in lectures 15,16.

- introduced \EF and \kF macros, like \kB.  Still places that use the full expansions prior to those macros.

- perhaps move some of the recent macros out of peeters_macros.sty into thisbook.sty

- ps2: incorporate grading comments:
   b) calculate unbounded propagator?

- do more of the kittel problems (all the recommended ones from chapters 1-6,8)

- work through lecture 13 (spin interaction) myself filling in all the details.

- search for mathematica references and change to nbref (if any).

- L13: plot the specific heat, the partition function, the average energy, and the magnetization.

- have rules for eps -> pdf from huang 9.3 problem.  Those generated files should be in the clean rules and .gitignore rules. (have implemented wildcard rules for them)

- move the phy452/ eps wildcard rule for figures/ into ../make.rules/vars ?

- non-integer binomial series.  Verify result for non-integer negative exponents.

- post final exam problem rework.
