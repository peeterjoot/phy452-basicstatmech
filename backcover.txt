This book contains lecture notes taken during the Winter 2013 session of
Basic Statistical Mechanics (PHY452H1S), a University of Toronto course that was 
taught by Prof. Arun Paramekanti.

Official course description:

   ``Classical and quantum statistical mechanics of noninteracting systems; the statistical basis of thermodynamics; ensembles, partition function; thermodynamic equilibrium; stability and fluctuations; formulation of quantum statistics; theory of simple gases; ideal Bose and Fermi systems.''

This book contains:

- Plain old lecture notes.   These mirror what was covered in class, possibly augmented with additional details.
- Personal notes exploring details that were not clear to me from the lectures, or from the texts associated with the lecture material.
- Assigned problems.  Like anything else take these as is.  I may or may not have gone back and corrected errors, and did not see the graded versions of the last two problem sets.
- Some worked problems attempted as course prep, test preparation, or post test reflection.
- Links to Mathematica workbooks associated with these notes.
