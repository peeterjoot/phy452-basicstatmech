\paragraph{Why do I need probabilities?}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item QM: Ultimately there's an underlying quantum state, and we can only talk about probabilities.  Any measurement has uncertainties, and this microscopic state forces us to use statistical methods.
\item Classical chaos and unpredictability: In a many particle system, or even a system of a few interacting particles with non-linear interaction, even given an initial state to 10 decimal places, we'll end up with uncertainties.  Given enough particles, even with simple interactions, we'll be forced to use statistical methods.
\item Too much information: Even if we suppose that we could answer the question of where is and how fast every particle in a large collection was, what would we do with that info.  We don't care about such a fine granularity state.  We want to know about things like gas pressure.  We are forced to discard information.
\end{itemize}
%
We need a systematic way of dealing with and discarding specific details.  We want to use statistical methods to throw away useless information.
%
\paragraph{Analogy: Election}
%
We can poll a sample of the population if we want to attempt to predict results.  We want to know things, but not what every person thinks.
