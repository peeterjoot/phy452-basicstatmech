\section{Equilibrium.}

This is the study of systems in \underlineAndIndex{equilibrium}.  What is equilibrium? \footnote{There's an excellent discussion of this in \S 1 \citep{ma1985statistical}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Mechanical equilibrium example: ball in bowl
\item Chemical equilibrium: when all the reactants have been consumed, or rates of forward and backwards reactions have become more constant.
\end{itemize}

More generally, equilibrium is a matter of time scales!

\paragraph{Feynman}
``Fast things have happened and all slow things have not''

\makeexample{Water in a cup}{example:basicStatMechLecture1:1}
{
After 1 min - 1 hour, when any sloshing has stopped, we can say it's in equilibrium.  However, if we consider a time scale like 10 days, we see that there are changes occurring (evaporation).
}

\makeexample{Hot water in a cup}{example:basicStatMechLecture1:2}{
Less than 10 minute time scale: Not in equilibrium (evaporating).  At a longer time scale we may say it's reached equilibrium, but again on a, say, 10 day time scale, we'd again reach the conclusion that this system is also not in equilibrium.

We go through state transitions
\begin{itemize}
\item Cooling: Not in equilibrium
\item Stay: In equilibrium
\item Evaporate: Not in equilibrium
\end{itemize}
%FIXME: tabularize
%		Hot water -> Cooling -> Stay -> evaporate
%equil				No    	Yes 	No
}

\makeexample{Window glass}{example:basicStatMechLecture1:3}{

\begin{itemize}
\item \(\sim 10\) years \(\rightarrow\) equilibrium.
\item \(\sim 100-1000\) years \(\rightarrow\) not in equilibrium.
\end{itemize}

While this was given in class as an example, \citep{stokes1999flowing} refutes this.

Steady current over a small time scale, but we are persistently generating heat and draining the battery.

\paragraph{How do we reach equilibrium?}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item We'll be looking at small systems connected to a very much larger ``heat bath'' or ``environment''.  Such a system will eventually, after perhaps exchange of particles, radiation, ... will eventually take on a state that is dictated by the state of the environment.
\item Completely isolated system!  Molecules in a box, say, may all initially be a corner of a box.  We'll have exchange of energy and momentum, and interaction with the walls of the box.  The ``final'' state of the system will be determined by the initial state of the molecules.  Experiments of this sort have recently been performed and studied in depth (actually a very tricky problem).
\end{itemize}
